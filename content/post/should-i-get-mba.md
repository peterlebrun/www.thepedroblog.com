Many years ago, like any 20-something, I realized that my job was unfulfilling and I needed to do something else.  So, I decided to go to grad school.  Two years later I had an MBA and $100K in student loans, and today I'm an individual contributor software architect (i.e. I'm really not doing anything related to the MBA).

People tell me all the time that they're thinking about getting an MBA.  In the majority of these cases, I think they're misguided.  Should you get an MBA?  Probably not.  There are a couple cases where it makes sense, but for the majority of people, an MBA is expensive, time-consuming, and not worthwhile.

One of the things you learn about in business school is "net present value".  Is the expected future value of an investment high enough to justify what it costs you today, and the amount of time that will pass?  An MBA is an investment of your time and energy.  You want to make sure that your return is worthwhile.

## What does an MBA cost?
MBAs are expensive.  The total investment you're making is out of pocket costs + opportunity costs + intangibles (time, effort, toll on your relationships). So if you're paying $65k/year for two years, and you're suddenly _not_ making $80k/year for two years, then the total cost of your MBA is about $290k.  This doesn't even take into account stress or time away from friends and family.

## Where will it take you?
This is the area where you really want to gain clarity.  If you know what you want to do, and why, it makes all the difference.  Here are the major reasons that I see people want to get an MBA:

- They want to change careers into a high paying role.  If you want to become an investment banker or consultant, an MBA will definitely help pave the way, and you'll be able to afford the student loan payments.  Note that if you want to break into these industries, you'll probably need a name-brand school.
- They want to start a company.  This is probably the worst possible reason to get an MBA.  You'll learn a lot more over those two years if you just start the company now.  And you'll probably have less debt at the end.
- They want to break into the C-suite at a large company.  This is another area where an MBA may make sense.  Most Fortune 500 CXOs have an MBA or something similar.  I bet most of them would make good executives anyway, but the MBA gains them access to "the club".
- They want to grow in their current role/career path.  Unless you're currently an investment banker, the MBA is probably overkill here.  If you want to go from an individual contributor to a manager, you'll make a lot more progress if you take some night classes in management (or see if your company offers management training).  You can also read Harvard Business Review and Wall Street Journal.  Or, seek out mentors within your current network.  All these options are much cheaper and faster than a full MBA.

## In conclusion
Some times an MBA makes sense, and some times it does not.  The most important thing is going in with eyes wide open, understanding what you want to get out of it, and knowing for certain that you're making a good investment.  If you can't say yes to all three of those criteria, then an MBA is probably not right for you.
