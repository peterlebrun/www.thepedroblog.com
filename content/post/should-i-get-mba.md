#Should you get an MBA?

* One of the things you learn about in B-school is "net present value" to determine if an investment is worthwhile.  Will it be worth more in the future than it is today, even when we account for the time involved?
* Getting an MBA is an investment just like anything else, and we can evaluate it the same way.
* What does it cost, and how will you pay for it?  MBAs are expensive, out of pocket (up to $100k/year), as well as opportunity cost (what are you currently doing for work?).  There is also costs in terms of your time, energy, and effect on your personal relationships.  Do you have rich parents that will pay for it?  Or savings?  Or a full ride?  Or are you going to finance it with loans?
* What do you want to do with it?
** Grow in current role - MBA is overkill.  Just do some coursera classes, read HBR and WSJ.
** Invest in the stock market - same deal.  Take a few finance classes, read some finance books, HBR and WSJ.
** Start a company - MBA is the worst decision you could make.  Just start the damn company.  You'll learn a lot more, probably come out of it with less debt, and possibly even have some time left over.  Who knows, you might even make some money from it.
** Just don't know what to do with my life - MBA is a very expensive way to kill time and find direction.
** Transition careers to something very high paying (consulting, banking, etc) - Probably a good move.  You'll learn a lot, the MBA program will open doors, and you can afford to pay the loans.  (Note that for these "elite" industries you're going to need to go to an "elite" school.  Doing a night program at the local public university won't get you to wall street).
** You want to get into the C-Suite at a large company - Many CXOs of large companies have MBAs (or something similar) - the degree is what helped them to build their networks and stand out when it came time to move from "director" to "VP".  I'm guessing that most of them would make good executives without the MBA, but the MBA just adds a nice touch to their resume.
