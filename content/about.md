I'm putting together this blog to really step up my markdown game and document more of my technical projects.  At my day job, I'm a devops engineer, but I secretly want to be either a fashion designer, [PhD student](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/phd/program-overview/system-dynamics/), or stock trader.

I'm currently working on a project to make stylish flannel lined jeans so I can brave the New England winters, and some sort of orgmode/fibit mashup app to help me manage my whole life and see if I can learn how to stay organized.
